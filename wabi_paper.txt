Just some quick notes on the structure we agreed on.

1. Intro

2. vBWT construction

3. Backward search

4. Graph: what variation to put in and construction cost:  If closer ref/haplotypes is our goal - what should be in the graph. Human genome, compare published GCSA figures.

5. Inference of closer reference. Show for 7G8 MSP3.4 - infer seq, new pileup errors

6. <optional - might push into discussion> Cost of alphabet size - wavelet tree takes us to O(logn). Would like to give a figure on mapping speed.

7. Conclusions and further work.


*Analyses to do *

1. New human PRG - done

2. 7G8 - on new implementation. <if we have to, give current results>

3. Mapping speed for 7G8 chr10, with exact matching.
